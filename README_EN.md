## Building the Application for Production

When you're ready to deploy your site, build the production version using:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized static files that can be uploaded to your hosting platform.

## Customizing the Site's Structure

When you run the build command, the application automatically creates a `structure.json` file in `public/markdown/`. This file defines the structure of your site based on the folder and file layout in the `public/markdown` directory.

To manually generate the `structure.json` without building the entire application, run:

```bash
npm run generate-index
```

You can also edit the `structure.json` file manually to customize the site's navigation, folder hierarchy, and link names without modifying the actual file structure.

### Flexibility of Structure.json:
- **Customizable Links**: Modify page links and their displayed names without changing the underlying file names.
- **Dynamic Hierarchy**: Organize your siteâ€™s layout by editing folder categories and sub-pages within `structure.json`, giving you full control over how your content is presented.
